    "In the [quickstart deduplication demo](quickstart_demo_deduplication.ipynb) we saw an example of how to use `splink`.  There was minimal customisation of the settings - the demo relies on the fact that when settings are not specified by the user, `splink` uses sensible default values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all settings have defaults - at minimum the user needs to choose the `link_type`, the `blocking_rules` and the `comparison_columns`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most real-world applications, more accurate results will be obtained by customising the settings, often by trial and error. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main way to do this is through the `settings` dictionary.  This is passed to `splink` like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from splink import Splink\n",
    "\n",
    "settings = { }  # Settings dictionary goes here\n",
    "\n",
    "linker = Splink(settings, spark, df=df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view 'sensible default' values that have been chosen for the other columns as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from splink.settings import complete_settings_dict\n",
    "complete_settings_dict(settings)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This settings dictionary can be quite complicated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide an [autocompleting settings editor](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink_settings_editor/), which makes it quicker and easier to write settings dictionaries.  At the bottom of this page, there is a 'settings dictionary key explorer', which allow you to see a full description of each setting and what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tools relies on the formal [json schema](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/blob/master/splink/files/settings_jsonschema.json) of the settings object.  You can also use this schema in some text editors to enable autocompletion - e.g. see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_intellisense-and-validation) for VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also validate a settings object within Python with the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from splink.validate import validate_settings\n",
    "validate_settings(settings)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more qualitative guidance about building a settings dictionary, see the [best practices and identifying problems](best_practices.ipynb) notebook."
